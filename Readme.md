## Audience & Purpose
"Pixel Path: The Road to Code" is a game designed for children in the 4th to 8th grade. Due to the education system
lacking a curriculum that aids or encourages children to explore coding, this game was created to hopefully suppliment
that which is missing from the current curriculum. The goals of this program is to "game-ify" basic coding concepts
and make them digestable for a younger audience.

## Description
The player will follow Pix, a small pixelated robot, through his adventure in trying to learn coding concepts.
For a quick example, in the first level the player will first help Pix determine what type (e.g. int, string, char)
applies to various inputs (e.g. "happy" "one" "1" "130" "c") in order to gain an understanding of types.
This will be presented to the player in the form of a quick paced sorting game. After this, the player will go on
to learn about more complex topics such as but not limited to:
    - if/conditional statements
    - loops
    - functions
    - what libraries are useful for
    - stack/queues
    - recursion
After a certain number of topics have been learned (and their levels completed), the player will go on to take part
in a recap of the prior topics in a boss fight. Completing this boss fight will unlock a new section of the map
with more complex topics.
